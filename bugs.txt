THESE BUGS ARE NOW FIXED AND THIS FILE IS KEPT FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES
####################################################################

created a folder and then created a new winrar archive inside of it
	other node got stuck trying to receive it
	Potential issue: winrar archives are a bit weird because they are directories but also not

created excel sheet before joining network
	other node got stuck tring to receive it
	Potential issue: file too big, it was 7KB
	restarted application on both ends without deleting xlsx and they synced properly

Added a 500KB PNG to the directory
	other node got stuck receiving, stuck on 6th byte
	Potential issue: file too big

Added 123B PNG to the directory
	other node got stuck receiving, stuck on 6th byte common theme
	Potential issue: not even sure, maybe client and server lost sync of position in tcp file
	sent 430B text file just fine
	sent 800KB text file just fine
	Potential issue: PNG format messes up the file transfer

Added 1.4MB bmp file to the directory
	other node stuck receiving, stuck on byte 3641
	Potential issue: image files have data that potentially messes with file transfer
	sent over 3 text files totaling 1MB+ and worked fine
		side note, it sent back 2 of the files even though the computer already had them
		not defects though, just strange
	sent over 100MB text file and it worked perfectly fine
	Potential issue: null characters in image files could be fucking us

BMP/PNG is reproduceable
	issue: seems to be certain ascii characters when read from a file cause issues with our 	current method
	so far ive pinpointed 0x1a and 0x8e to be problem characters
	FIX: USE ios::binary WHEN OPENING FILE
